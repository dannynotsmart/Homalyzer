# Homalyzer

Homalyzer is a AI powered tool, designed to mimick a real estate agent, to find listings of homes from a user's inputs. You can watch the demo we used for our presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP_BAixhwEI).

We used Next.JS to build the website, OpenAI for the chatbot functionality, and a web scraping service to find home listings.

This was our submission for [AtomHacks 10](https://atomhacks.org/), and will not be worked on any further.
